    'description' => 'Observatorna Street, where the hotel complex "Dzherelo" is located, was formed in the
                middle of 19 century due to construction of Kyiv University observatory in 1841- 1845s.
                In the time of Kyiv Russ this area, where the modern Observatorna Street is, formed a part
                of trade-workmanship place "Kopyreva Kintsia". According to the chronicle it was a part of
                "Schekavytsky Hills". Therefore some historians considered the annalistic Schekavytska was
                the hill where observatory is located and presumably Kyiv knyaz Oleg was buried here in 912.
                In 30s of 20s century some constructions in the style of constructivism were built in Observatorna
                Street. The history of the building in 21 Observatorna Street is connected with Yanovsky family
                history who lived in the street from 70s of 19 century. The archpriest Porfyry Erofiyovych
                Yanovsky bought quire a large estate for that time on Observatorna Lane. The priest P. E.
                Yanovsky had 4 children. And later the Yanovsky is estate was divided into 4 parts.
                The estate on 21 Observatorna Lane belonged to the priest\'s youngest daughter
                — Kopitaini Porfyrivni Yanovsky. The mansion was built in 1890s presumably under
                the project of the architect M. Nikolaev. The three-store construction is made of
                bricks, known as brick style of the end of 19 century, L-shaped in the plan. Lateral
                projections in one window opening which are underlined with the tracery ledge play
                the main role in artistically — figurative perception of the building. The window
                openings are right-angled with castle stones and plaster additions under the windows.
                The ground floor is decorated with modellings, the facade is beautified with plastic
                ornament and there are also 3 large decorative arms in the middle of the attic and over
                the doorway. Inside of the arms the letter «H» is located, and it is the first letter of
                the surname of the estate owners Yanovsky. The building has significantly marked division
                between the floors and also the complex decorative cornice. After 1918 the construction was
                used as a mansion. At the end of 1995 the building was transferred to the possession
                of open stock company oUkrnaftw) that reconstructed it into the hotel complex.
                In January 1999 the hotel complex receivedfirst guests and visitors. There are 15
                comfortable, modern, fully-equipped rooms of various classes, saunas, a swimming
